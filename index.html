    <h2> ‚òû Object </h2> 
      <p> Be the first person to knock down your gingerbread man
        without knocking down anyone else‚Äôs! </p>
    
    <br/>
  
    <h2> ‚òû Setup </h2>

      <p style=margin-left:40px;> 3. Unfold gameboard such that the blue side is facing up. 
             Lay flat on a tabletop such that the edge of the board 
        (approximately 4-5 inches) is hanging off of the tabletop. </p>
      <p style=margin-left:40px;> 4. Place each of the the gingerbread men on the hanging edge of the gameboard,
